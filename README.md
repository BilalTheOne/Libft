libft - Library 42
Project libft

Welcome to the README of libft, also known as Library 42. The library constitutes the first project at 42 school, where we build, from scratch, numerous standard functions in C programming language.

Features of libft
Standard Utilities: The standard utilities of libft replicate several regularly used functionalities like printf, strdup, memcpy etc.

String Utilities: The library offers a robust set of string manipulation functions. From getting the length of a string (strlen) to copying strings (strcpy), the library has several such handy functionalities.

Memory Utilities: Managing dynamic memory allocations like memory copying (memcpy), and setting memory (memset) can be done effortlessly using the memory utilities of libft.

List Utilities: libft also provides functions to handle and manipulate different types of data structures effectively.

Getting Started
This section will guide you on how to get a copy of libft on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)
C compiler (preferably gcc)
Basic knowledge of C programming

Contributing
Contributions are not open at this stage, but check back frequently for any updates in the contribution guidelines.
